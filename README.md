# Advanced_IVR
Changing the way we use Interactive Voice Response through our innovation and thinking.

This is poweful "NLP" model which works on the principle of sending the valid registered complaints(rejecting the useless complaints like I would like to order food) to its correct department in the bank. 

Registered complaints can be solved with a higher resolution scope because the priority complains would be reaching to the highest officials available at that time.

Priority complains like loss of debit card can be solved within minutes of complaining.

Cost reduction as call time of IVR would be less and we would require less number of customer care executives.

Proper redressal can be done  which would again increase the customer satisfaction and the bank could find time and money to solve more important issues.

## Getting Started
1.) Starting the Ai Model

	
	To run the complete project you need to have the following packages imported correctly in the system:
		1: Python Version >= 3.5 <= 3.5.6
		2: pip install pickle-(Any version)
		3: pip install Keras-(Any version)
		4: pip install Sklearn-(Any version)
		5: pip install Numpy-(Any version)
		6: pip install pandas-(Any version)
		7: pip install tensorflow==1.7.0
		8: pip install workdog-(Any Version)
		Please set the working directory bank_d and run cmd.
		In cmd Window Type- python syndhack.py
		If all the libraries are correctly installed then the python file should run in the backend of the system.

	Minimize the cmd window and follow the below steps
2.)  Starting the Website 

	To run the complete project you need to have nodejs configured on your system with nodemon globally installed.
		1: Open CMD/Terminal in Root Project named one (for user).
		2: installing packages write npm install.
			running the server: write "nodemon" to run
					    listening on port 8000.
					    connected to db.
		3: Open CMD/Terminal in Root Project named one/rec2 (for user audio recording).
		4: installing packages write npm install.
			running the server: write "nodemon" to run
					    listening on port 7000.
					    connected to db.
		5: Open CMD/Terminal in Root Project named two (for admin).
		6: installing packages write npm install.
			running the server: write "nodemon" to run
					    listening on port 9000.
					    connected to db.
		
			#Now proceed as the workflow goes through the User Interface.
